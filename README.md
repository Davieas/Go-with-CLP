<h1>GoLang in Industrial Ambient</h1>

<h3>This project seeks to implement low-level programming languages in an industrial environment so that "Basic" Programmers can become useful and feel inserted i
n the industrial area, thus having a wider range of possibilities to choose their area of activity. </h3>

<h5>After all, what are the advantages of having golang in the industrial environment?</h5>

<ul>
  <li>It is a very optimized language.</li>
  <li>Compiled language, with strong static typing.</li>
  <li>Easy to use, but low-level syntax</li>
  <li>Easy to learn and apply to any code editor</li>

</ul>

<h5>Compared to ladder, the main PLC language inspired by electrical commands, Golang has none of these but has many similarities, some of the similarities are that both languages are compiled, but Go has a performance up to 100 times faster and much more optimized, we also have the similarity of low level language in both, but Go turns out to be much more friendly in relation to ladder, and the biggest advantage of Go is that it can be used in any code editor, while ladder can only be used in specific software from PLC manufacturers.</h5>

<h1>But how does the project work anyway?</h1>
<h5>This project serves as a PLC supervisor, as it is not yet possible to upload a Golang code to the PLC, but with the possibility of Go to create Windows or Linux applications, then we could have an interface all in Go to control the PLC.</h5>
